# Lambda_Iterator
Lab showcasing sets, iterators, filter, and maps using java.
In this lab we are showcasing Java sets, iterators, filter, and maps using java. In the first file, SetLambda, we are creating a hah set with integers from 1 - 20 that uses a lambda expression in order to filter the even numbers and print them. After that, we use another lambda expression in order to square each number in the set and then print the squared numbers. In the second class,  SetIterators, we are once again creating a hash set with integers from 1 - 20, but this time we are using an iterator in order to iterator through the set using a while loop. Inside of the while loop, we have each element is even and prints if they are. This code is much shorter due to simply showcasing a traditional iterator traversing a set and nothing else. Finally in the third class, SetOperations, we are using hash sets in java to show operations. We begin by creating two sets, populating them with integers, and using Union, Intersection, and Difference from math on the sets.
